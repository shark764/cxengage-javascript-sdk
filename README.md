## Overview

FIXME: Write a paragraph about the library/project and highlight its goals.

## Development

To run the project:

`boot dev`

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3449/`.

To connect via repl once `dev` is running:

`boot repl` followed by `(start-repl)`

To run tests once:

`boot test-once`

To run tests in the background and have them re-run every time you make a change:

`boot test`

To make a prod release (you shouldn't ever really have to do this; jenkins does it for us)

`boot make-prod-release`
