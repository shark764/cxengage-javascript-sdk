## [5.2.1]

## [5.1.0]
* CXV1-9468 Added work-cancel interrupt for Click-to-dial interactions

* CXV1-9496 Added additional error messaging around attempting to accept an expired work offer

## [5.0.1]
* CXV1-9346 - Split note actions out into their own independent public-facing functions. Does not impact the front-end.
* CXV1-9428 - Fixed failing to retrieve email bodies on incoming emails

## [5.0.0]
* ** BREAKING ** refactored entities module - each entity now has it's own function and will require passing the proper type-id ie; "resource-id" rather than the generic "entity-id".
* ** BREAKING ** changed global window exposure from "serenova.cxengage.api...." to just "CxEngage"
* ** BREAKING ** removed (due to them now being necessary) the "capabilities" pub/sub messages
* added graceful logout functionality
* removed build-api-url-with-params, replace with api-url
* Because of the above two changes, the usage for initializating the SDK is now: CxEngage.initialize(options). Beyond that you will need to just reference "CxEngage" on the window, and *not create an alias to it like you used to* (via var SDK = serenova.cxengage.initialize(options);)
* reporting functions moved to Reporting Module.
* add paging functionality to get contact interaction history
* added stat-query function to reporting module - allows for one-off batch queries

* renamed "goOffline" (in session) - changed to "logout" in authentication
* fixed pub/sub system to only call callbacks for the subscribers whose topics match
* removed the ability to pass callbacks as a part of the params object (must be passed as a 2nd parameter)
